Helps you increase sales conversions by decreasing the response time under 1 minute. Faster you answer your leads, more clients you have.

== Description ==

59sec lite helps companies to answer leads (or new contacts) under 1 minute (59 seconds). 

Why? 
Because studies done by MIT and Kellogg (published on Forbes) show that answering a lead in 5 minutes versus 30 seconds means 21x more chances to close the sale. So, we are helping you answer under 1 minute, not in 5. :)

How? 
Via instant notifications: when a new Contact Form 7 form is submitted, all sales agents get a push notification on their iOS and Android devices
Also, 59sec lite has a lead management procedure to help the sales team nurture the lead until it become a sale.


How it works (technically speaking)?

First you install the 59sec lite wordpress plugin on your site. Done!
Second, you set up the plugin. Specify the "Entry Source" from the existing Contact Form 7 forms.
Third, you put everybody from the sales team to install the mobile apps (iOS and Android available).
Under notification tab, you will get a Secret Key (32 chars, alpha numeric). Insert this key on the mobile app, to connect the app to your site.

That's it! You can start testing it.

Recommended procedure:
Step 1. After the sales agents are notified of a new lead, one of them will enter on the site (via phone/tablet or computer) to actually grab the lead. The counter will stop, so the sales manager will know how lazy or how professionals are they.
Step 2. After grabbing the lead, the sales agent should immediately call the potential client.
Step 3. After the call, the sales agent should set the right status of the lead + enter some details. The lead nurturing should continue, until the status become final.
Step 4. Look at the statistics, so you know how good/bad is the situation.

Using 59sec lite really boost conversion, if it's done properly. Just do it properly then :)
